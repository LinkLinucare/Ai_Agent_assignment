Subject: Thank You for Your Application

Dear John,

Thank you for your interest in the developer position at CrewAI and for taking the time to submit your application. We truly appreciate the effort you put into your application and enjoyed learning about your background as a junior developer.

Your experience with front-end technologies and your passion for web development are commendable. However, after careful consideration, we have decided to move forward with other candidates at this time.

We encourage you to keep an eye on future openings that may align with your skills as we were impressed with your ability to build responsive websites using React, CSS, and HTML.

Thank you once again for your interest in CrewAI, and we wish you all the best in your job search and future endeavors.

Warm regards,

Sarah  
HR Coordinator  
CrewAI
